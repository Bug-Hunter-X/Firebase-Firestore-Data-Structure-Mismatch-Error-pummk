This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Firestore applications: data structure mismatches.  The `firestore-data-mismatch.js` file shows how an application can fail if it expects a certain data structure but the Firestore data differs. The solution, found in `firestore-data-mismatch-solution.js`, demonstrates how to robustly handle such inconsistencies and prevent application crashes.
